Another project with few Robotics materials :wink:

## motivation

So I got admitted into Udacity's Robotics Nano Degree program, which going on amazing :smile:

Learning a lot of new stuff, so I decided to share all projects that I'm going to build during this course.

## work

### platform requirement

As model/ world file(s) are created using [Gazebo](http://gazebosim.org/), you'll require to install _Gazebo_ on your machine.

I'm using _Ubuntu 19.10_, and it's working fine.

Make sure you have `cmake, make, g++` installed on you machine. 

And don't forget to clone this repo into your machine.

### projects

- [x] [Build my world](docs/gazebo_project_one.md)
- [ ] Go chase it


Thanking you :blush:
